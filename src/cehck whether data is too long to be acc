- [x] cehck whether data is too long to be accepted in isDataComplete
- [ ] how do we verify that a packet hasnt stopped mid-send in isDatacomplete? in server and socket
- [ ] what are all the socket states? they dont seem useful for anything at all. once we can write we do it all at once anyways, so its stupid right now. instead they need to be set to what poll outputs and if theyre not ready yet we still gotta wait
- [ ] has client closed connection if data <= 0 or is it just slow internet? server/poll - i think just pollhup

freddy
- [ ] why does one socket still handle multiple clients? why can it be constructed without an fd? whyyyyyy?
- [ ] why does socket have so many useless functions
- [ ] redirect functions are fucking weird - why always 302? why is any of this happening



check read and write before writing or reading
